# Go bcrypt Vulnerable Demo

This simple Go program demonstrates password hashing using the `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt` package.

## What the Program Does

The program takes a plaintext password (`mySecret123`) and hashes it using bcrypt. It then prints the hashed password to the console.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.20 or later recommended).

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ghadeer-elsalhawy/antrea-Renovate-lfx.git
   cd antrea-Renovate-lfx

text

2. Run the program:
   go run main.go

You should see the hashed password output in your terminal.

## External Dependency

- **Package:** `golang.org/x/crypto`
- **Version:** v0.23.0 (vulnerable)
- **Purpose:** Provides the bcrypt implementation used for password hashing.
